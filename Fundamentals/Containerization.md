Virtualization is the process where physical servers are divided/segemented into multiple Virtual Machine (VM) by installing hypervisor on it such that each virtual machine has its own logical isolation of resources.  
Whereas containerization involves creating containers by insatlling conatinerization platform like DOCKER on either of two cases:  
1. Installing docker (containerization platform on VM like EC2 instance) and create container on it. This method is now most widely used while considering the microservices world of architecture designing of services or application.  
2. Installing docker directly on physical server.
